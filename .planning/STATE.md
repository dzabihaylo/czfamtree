# STATE: CZ Family Tree

**Last updated:** 2026-04-21

## Project Reference

- **Name:** CZ Family Tree (czfamtree)
- **Core value:** A person opens the app, sees their family on a clean canvas, and adds/edits relatives without friction. The canvas + radial-add loop must feel effortless.
- **Current focus:** Initialization complete — roadmap drafted, awaiting approval to begin Phase 1 planning.
- **Planning root:** `.planning/`

## Current Position

- **Milestone:** v1 Launch
- **Phase:** (none yet — pre-Phase 1)
- **Plan:** —
- **Status:** Roadmap drafted. Ready for `/gsd-plan-phase 1` once user approves.
- **Progress:** [░░░░░░░░░░] 0 / 5 phases complete

### Roadmap Overview

| Phase | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1. Foundation | Signed-in user lands in own private tree with schema + RLS correct | Not started |
| 2. Canvas, Nodes & Edit | Pan/zoom canvas, PersonNode, SidePanel, trustworthy auto-save | Not started |
| 3. Authoring & History | Radial-add, undo/redo, toolbar, toasts, search, a11y | Not started |
| 4. Tidy & Layout | Dagre couple-merge layout with animated transition | Not started |
| 5. Share & Realtime | Share modal, Realtime presence + cursors + broadcast, deploy | Not started |

## Performance Metrics

Baseline targets (tracked once implementation begins):

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Canvas render (200 nodes + edges) | 60fps during pan/zoom | — |
| RLS p95 latency on `people.select` at 200 rows | < 100ms | — |
| Auto-save round-trip (field edit → server ACK → pill green) | < 500ms on broadband | — |
| Cursor broadcast throttle | ≤ 100ms (Supabase sweet spot) | — |
| Undo memory after 500 edits | < 50MB heap | — |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions (from PROJECT.md)

- Next.js 16 App Router + React 19 + TS + Tailwind v4 (Clerk 7 requires this)
- Clerk 7 + Supabase **native** third-party auth (NOT the deprecated JWT template)
- RLS uses `auth.jwt()->>'sub'` (Clerk `sub` is text, never cast via `auth.uid()`)
- `@dagrejs/dagre@3.x` (scoped, maintained) — NOT unscoped `dagre@0.8.5`
- Zustand 5 + zundo 2 + immer 11 (patch-based history, not full snapshots)
- Custom CSS transform for pan/zoom (~120 LOC, no library)
- Edges **derived** from `people[].spouseIds/parentIds/childIds` — never stored
- Relationships as arrays on `people` (NOT a join table) for v1 — pending Phase 1 decision on step-relations
- Last-write-wins per field (no CRDT)
- One Realtime channel per tree: `tree:${treeId}` (presence + broadcast multiplexed)
- Optimistic-local + authoritative-server + reconcile-via-Realtime-broadcast (not Postgres CDC)
- Ship handoff steps 1–8 as v1 (Share included); Google Sheets sync deferred to v2

### Open Questions / Todos

- **Phase 1 planning:** decide step-relations data model before schema freeze — accept `parent_ids ≤ 2` limitation OR promote to `relationships` table
- **Phase 4 planning:** empirically tune dagre `nodesep` / `ranksep` against 5+ fixture families (singleton, couple+children, remarriage chain, adoption, half-siblings)
- **Phase 5 planning:** deep research on Realtime channel lifecycle, Clerk token refresh timing, and RLS re-audit under sharing + viewer-role scenarios

### Blockers

None currently. User approval of the roadmap is the only gate to beginning Phase 1 planning.

## Session Continuity

### Last Session

- Initialization workflow (`/gsd-new-project`)
  - Captured PROJECT.md (core value, constraints, 12 key decisions)
  - Captured REQUIREMENTS.md (106 v1 REQs across 23 categories, 17 v2 REQs across 4 categories)
  - Completed research: SUMMARY.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, STACK.md, FEATURES.md, PITFALLS.md (HIGH confidence overall)
  - Drafted ROADMAP.md with 5 coarse phases, 106/106 coverage

### Next Session

Run `/gsd-plan-phase 1` to decompose Phase 1 (Foundation) into executable plans. Phase 1 planning must resolve the step-relations decision before schema is frozen.

### Context Notes

- Design handoff at `design_handoff_family_tree/` is a high-fidelity React/HTML prototype — treat colors, typography, and spacing as pixel-parity targets. Prototype code is not production.
- Granularity is **coarse** — expect 1–3 plans per phase. Do not over-decompose.
- Parallelization is enabled — Phase 4 and Phase 5 planning can overlap once Phase 3 is complete.
- Model profile is `quality`; tests enabled via Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E) per TEST-01 / TEST-02.
- Deployment target: Vercel with Clerk + Supabase env vars (DEP-01). Next.js pinned ≥ 16 (DEP-02) to close CVE-2025-29927.
